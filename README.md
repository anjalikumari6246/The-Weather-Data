# Weather Forecasting Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project involves the analysis and prediction of weather patterns using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes daily climate data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure. The analysis involves data exploration, visualization, and the development of a predictive model to forecast future temperatures.

## Data Source

The dataset used for this project is included in the repository as `1. Weather Data.csv`. It contains comprehensive weather information such as temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and pressure.

## Project Structure

The project repository contains the following files:

- `Weather_Forcast.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data exploration, analysis, and machine learning model development.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
- `1. Weather Data.csv`: The dataset used for analysis.
- `model.pkl`: Serialized model file for deployment (optional).
- `requirements.txt`: A list of Python packages required to run the notebook.
